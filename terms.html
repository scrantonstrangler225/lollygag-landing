  <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
  <p>Last updated: September 1, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>
    These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of the Lollygag beta platform, services, and website (collectively, the "Service").
    By signing up for our beta or using any part of the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Beta Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>
    The Lollygag platform is currently in beta. Features and functionality may change over time as we continue to develop and improve the Service. 
    All updates will follow standards appropriate for healthcare-related applications, including but not limited to data provenance, backup integrity, and system reliability. 
    While the platform is evolving, we are committed to ensuring these changes uphold the principles of safety, transparency, and data stewardship.
  </p>

  <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
  <p>
    You agree not to misuse the Service. This includes (but is not limited to) attempting to gain unauthorized access, disrupting service performance,
    or sharing inappropriate or illegal content.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>
    All content and branding on the Service (except for your own content submitted via forms) remains the property of Lollygag.
    You may not copy, reuse, or distribute it without permission.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Termination</h2>
  <p>
    We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service at our discretion, especially in cases of abuse or violation of these Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Changes to Terms</h2>
  <p>
    These Terms may be updated periodically. If changes are significant, we’ll try to notify you via email or on our site.
    Continued use of the Service after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
